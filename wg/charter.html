			<h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
			<p>The vision of the Sustainable Web Interest Group is to provide evidence-led guidance alongside methods to observe, measure, and improve the sustainability of digital products and services. Through this guidance created by web developers, implementers, and other stakeholders of the Internet economy, they may better understand the Internet's impact on various forms of sustainability reporting and evolving implementable holistic practices. This not only includes digital emissions but also interconnecting variables that can additionally impact digital sustainability. To address these challenges, designers, developers, and product teams can apply stewardship principles to digital products, services, and data delivered via the Internet.</p>
		</div>
		<section id="scope" class="scope todo">
			<!-- Rewrite per W3C: https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues/105 -->
			<h2>Scope</h2>
			<p>This group pursues the following sustainability goals:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Reducing global carbon emissions.</li>
				<li>Reducing consumption of energy and material resources.</li>
				<li>Improving resilience of digital products and businesses.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Interest Group discusses many use cases to determine how standards - both those focused on (and shaped by) sustainability can benefit the industry, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Wider adoption of guidelines to reduce carbon emissions and resource use.</li>
				<li>Existing regulatory (<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en#legislation">CSRD</a> etc) and standards (<a href="https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/">GRI</a>) compliance to reach a wider global audience.</li>
				<li>Methods to reduce emissions reinforce (but don't replace) existing beneficial practices (Accessibility, Performance, Privacy, Security, etc).</li>
				<li>Broader interoperability, compatibility, and stability within the Web ecosystem.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Sustainable Web Interest Group develops guidelines and supporting materials that address how the following topics relate to the above sustainability goals:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Websites &amp; Web Applications:</strong> User-facing digital products, services, and websites.</li>
				<li><strong>Authoring Tools &amp; User Agents:</strong> Tools which directly interact with the Internet.</li>
				<li><strong>User Experience Design:</strong> Processes by which digital products or services are designed and created.</li>
				<li><strong>Metrics Data:</strong> Sustainability research analytics, ratings, and emissions or resource calculations.</li>
				<li><strong>Hosting &amp; Infrastructure:</strong> Within the remit of transmitting, delivering, or managing digital assets.</li>
				<li><strong>Business:</strong> In relation to the creation or management of digital teams and assets.</li>
			</ul>
			<section id="section-out-of-scope">
				<h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
				<p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Interest group.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Non-web aspects of native applications in both mobile &amp; desktop environments:</strong> However, Web applications remain in scope.</li>
					<li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Unless denoted through in-scope section on Hosting &amp; Infrastructure, we will not provide coverage of the manufacturing or usage of products beyond the remit of Internet-usage.</li>
					<li><strong>Horizontal Reviews:</strong> This interest group will not conduct horizontal reviews of other groups' specifications.</li>

			<section id="normative">
				<h3>Normative Specifications</h3>
				<p>The Interest Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt id="web-foo" class="spec"><a href="#">Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG) 1.0</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This specification explains how to design and implement digital products and services that put people and the planet first. The guidelines are best practices based on measurable, evidence-based research; aimed at end-users, web workers, stakeholders, tool authors, educators, and policymakers.</p>
						<p class="draft-status"><b>Draft state:</b> <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/">Adopted from Draft CG Report</a></p>
						<p class="milestone"><b>Expected completion:</b> <i class="todo">[Q1-4 YYYY]</i></p>
						<!-- Expected completion date is requird above. -->
						<p class="note todo"><b>Note:</b> The Sustainable Web Design Community Group has taken a holistic approach to sustainability, encompassing environmental, social, and economic (ESG) considerations (see, for example <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">United Nations</a>, <a href="https://www.sustainability.gov/federalsustainabilityplan/index.html">US Gov [Sustainability]</a>, <a href="https://www.nypa.gov/about/vision2030/foundational-pillars-environment-social-governance">NYPA</a>, <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2023/12/21/developing-a-set-of-principles-for-the-design-and-delivery-of-greener-services/">UK Gov [Defra]</a>). This broad approach has the advantage of aligning with some regulatory expectations (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/policies.html">Laws & Policies</a>) and creating a framework that is more likely to achieve success by extending beyond code and hardware to people and practices. The scope of the Interest Group charter is narrower than that of the Community Group, and as a result, the Community Group anticipates that some of the guidelines of the Community Group's initial report will not be part of a future Recommendation. The Community Group may continue to leverage some of the material not taken up by the Interest Group in order to support the future Recommendation, for example through good practice documentation.</p>

			<!-- Create SC: https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues/106 -->
			<h2>Success Criteria</h2>
			<p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites.</p>
			<p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
			<p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications in Candidate Recommendation or to features that have deployed implementations should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>. Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform Tests</a> project.</p>
			<p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
			<p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
			<p>This Interest Group expects to follow the TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="coordination">
			<h2>Coordination</h2>
			<p>For all specifications, this Interest Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The
			Interest Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification. The Interest Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>
			<p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

		<section class="participation">
			<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
			<p>To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Interest Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.</p>
			<p>The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.</p>
			<p>The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.</p>
			<p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="communication">
			<h2>Communication</h2>
			<p id="public">Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however, information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <i class="todo"><a href="">Sustainable Web Interest Group home page.</a></i></p>
			<!-- We will require a shortname for the URL: https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/[shortname]/join -->
			<p>Most Sustainable Web Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.</p>
			<p>This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues">GitHub issues</a></i>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work. This group also uses utilizes the public mailing list <i class="todo"><a id="public-name" href="">public-[email-list]@w3.org</a> (<a href="">archive</a>)</i> for event notifications and important announcements.</p>
			<!--
				We will require a IG name to associate with a W3C mailing list:
				mailto:public-[email-list]@w3.org
				https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-[email-list]/
			-->
			<p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="decisions">
			<h2>Decision Policy</h2>
			<p>This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
			<p>However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.</p>
			<p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.</p>
			<p>All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.</p>
			<p>This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="patentpolicy">
			<h2>Patent Disclosures</h2>
			<p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section 6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply.
