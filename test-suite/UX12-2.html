		<p>We provide a variety of useful materials to help with the transitional process from when we have completed our work to the stage where you will assume control over the work that you have paid for. Naturally, this can seem quite scary but hopefully, by reading our friendly, interactive guidebook you can learn how to work with the software you will need to continue maintaining what we have created for many years to come.</p>
