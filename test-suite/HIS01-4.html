		<p>Our website is hosted on <em>100% renewable energy</em> which can be verified as a sustainable supplier <strong class="brand">Brand X</strong> through the <a href="https://app.greenweb.org/directory/">Green Web Foundation Directory</a>.</p>
		<p>Test passes if a claim is made that can be verified through an independent source (and does not rely on carbon credits).</p>
