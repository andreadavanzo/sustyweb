		<h1>Sustainability Statement</h1>
		<p>Currently, we do not use a design system for our product, this is something we hope to change in the future to increase the reusability of components and to reduce wasted effort and machine time. As such, this has an increased carbon impact on our development cycles and we have increased offsetting attempts in other areas to compensate.</p>
		<p>Test passes if it's noted that no design system was identified as a central source of truth.</p>
