		<h1>Carbon Awareness</h1>
		<p>Currently, we do not monitor our service for periods of intensity nor do we optimize on-the-fly for the most efficient periods to use renewables and allow more intensive practices to occur. As such, we have to scale our offerings based on popularity alone which is something we can improve upon in the future.</p>
		<p>Test passes if features of the product or service alter based on the intensity of the environment.</p>
