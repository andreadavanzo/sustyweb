		<h1>Information about Web Standards</h1>
		<p>Unlike traditional programming, creating a website uses a range of different languages. Each of those languages has its purpose and goal.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>HTML for example defines the structure of the website and holds the content in an accessible format.</li>
			<li>CSS visually coordinates everything into a customized design.</li>
			<li>JavaScript provides interactive features and functionality.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Web browsers have existed for a long time also, they attempt to read the code that developers have produced and interpret that data into a visual representation of those instructions. This is what the visitor will see when they browse a page.</p>
		<p>Test passes if paragraphs are broken into easier to read blocks.</p>
