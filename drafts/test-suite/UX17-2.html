		<h1>Animation-free Page!</h1>
		<p>While animation can be exciting, we have decided not to include any on this page to increase the performance of our website. It has reduced the size of our codebase considerably and it hasn't impacted the user-experience. There are other ways we can enrich the experience for visitors without potentially causing accessibility issues so we shall do that instead.</p>
		<p>Test passes if the number of animations does not exceed a stated limit.</p>
