		<h1>Sustainability Statement</h1>
		<p>We have created this page to give you details about our path towards sustainability.</p>
		<h2>Our Journey</h2>
		<p>Since the year 1998 we have been building wonderful products, yet we have come to realize that our need to work in harmony with the planet is also critical, it's with this in mind that we have adjusted our practices to ensure that people and the planet are taken care of for future generations.</p>
		<p>We are decarbonizing our work, following the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/">Web Sustainability Guidelines</a>, and making sure that our path to being carbon neutral by 2025 is maintained.</p>
		<p>Test passes if a sustainability statement exists, a journey is provided, emissions data is listed, and goals are defined.</p>
