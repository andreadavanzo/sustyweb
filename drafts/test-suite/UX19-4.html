		<p><strong>Speaker 1</strong> Hello and welcome to the podcast!</p>
		<p><strong>Speaker 2</strong> Yes, thanks for joining us. This is just a quick catchup episode to tell you about our new product.</p>
		<p><strong>Speaker 1</strong> Cool, what is that new product?</p>
		<p><strong>Speaker 2</strong> It's a bunch of digital flowers you can send to a friend!</p>
		<p><strong>Speaker 2</strong> You can email them, or send them via DM over social media, it's the new way to say you appreciate someone.</p>
		<p><strong>Speaker 1</strong> That's nice, where can you get them?</p>
		<p><strong>Speaker 2</strong> Our website of course, and they don't trigger allergies like real flowers which is cool.</p>
		<p><strong>Speaker 1</strong> Awesome, so thats pretty much it for our catchup, thanks for listening, we'll have a proper episode next week. Bye</p>
