		<h1>Use of Analytics</h1>
		<p>This website values your privacy, as such, we choose not to measure traffic using analytics even though it could improve our products and services and instead use other forms of sustainable interactions with our customers to gather feedback. As such, you can feel great that you are not being spied upon.</p>
		<p>Test passes if analytics is either sustainable or not being used.</p>
