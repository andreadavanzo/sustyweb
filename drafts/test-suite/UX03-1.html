		<h1>Sustainability Statement</h1>
		<p>We are aware that delivery to our customers is critically important, and sustainability is a part of that process. As such, we have calculated using <a href="https://www.cocooncarbon.co.uk/">this third-party</a> product that our overall consignment weight for the year leads to <strong>98,275Kg C02</strong> due to the necessary use of freight shipping via air and road. To offset these emissions we have planted over 10,000 trees in a certified sustainable scheme which is in a preserved woodland thereby ensuring that the carbon will not be inaccurately accounted for.</p>
		<p>Test passes if the external impact is listed within a sustainability statement.</p>
