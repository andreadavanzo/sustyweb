		<h1>Information about Web Standards</h1>
		<p>Unlike traditional programming, creating a website uses a range of different languages. Each of those languages has its purpose and goal. HTML for example defines the structure of the website and holds the content in an accessible format. CSS visually coordinates everything into a customized design. JavaScript provides interactive features and functionality.</p>
		<p>Web browsers have existed for a long time also, they attempt to read the code that developers have produced and interpret that data into a visual representation of those instructions. This is what the visitor will see when they browse a page.</p>
		<p>Test passes if the content above has a reasonable level of readability.</p>
