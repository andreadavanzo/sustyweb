			<p>Sustainable Tooling And Reporting (<abbr title="Sustainable Tooling And Reporting">STAR</abbr>) 1.0 provides information, examples, and metrics data to complement the Web Sustainability Guidelines (<abbr title="Web Sustainability Guidelines">WSG</abbr>) 1.0 specification. Within this supplementary document, you will find implementation advice (for external groups wishing to incorporate sustainability in their work), an evaluation methodology (for testing conformance), a categorized series of techniques (potential implementations and case studies), and a test suite (metrics data on impact and machine automation capability).</p>
			<p>As with the <abbr title="Web Sustainability Guidelines">WSGs</abbr>, these features have been inspired by the work of the Web Accessibility Initiative ([[WAI]]). They have also been curated with a Web sustainability methodology, with the goal of better understanding the digital landscape's role in reducing harm to the wider ecosystem (regarding people and the planet).</p>
			<p>For the normative technical specification, see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/">https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/</a>.</p>

		<section> <!-- Implementation -->
			<h2>Implementation Advice</h2>
			<p>The following section provides advisory guidance for other specification writers and external groups wishing to incorporate digital sustainability within their work (such as W3C Working and Community Groups). We are primarily a group dedicated to fostering sustainable change in Web technologies associated with the creation of websites and applications. While it is outside of our group's scope to conduct horizontal reviews of other group's specifications, we may request or accept requests to collaborate with or assist in coordination with other groups to implement sustainable change.</p>
			<section> <!-- Considerations -->
				<h3>Considerations</h3>
				<p>The WSGs have a broad appeal, designed to impact a wide range of Web technologies and related infrastructure as appropriate. With this in mind, when first starting to look to incorporate sustainability within a body of work you may find that certain guidelines more than others will apply to practices.</p>
				<p>When designing any fledgling body of work it's worth considering the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Can a sustainability policy be put in place to vet work appropriately?</li>
					<li>If any guidelines are applicable, can they be included as "hard and fast rules"?</li>
					<li>If not (due to a conflict), can this be resolved without impacting the benefit?</li>
					<li>Can research to identify any sustainability benefits that are yet undiscovered be undertaken?</li>
					<li>Is education for consumers on a work's environmental impact being provided?</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="note">
					<p>When creating specifications or industry-specific documents, cross-reference to specific WSG guidelines that are appropriate for a body of work to connect elements of content to applicable sustainability goals.</p>
					<p>Create new sustainability guidelines that are explicitly targeted for a technology (that may be too niche to be included within the WSGs). This would provide additional Success Criteria for an audience to meet.</p>
					<p>If you do wish to create additional targeted guidelines, please first consult the <abbr title="Sustainable Web Design Community Group">SWD-CG</abbr> as we may be able to include them within the main WSGs or provide guidance to avoid conflicts with other existing guidelines.</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section> <!-- Methodology -->
				<h3>Methodology</h3>
				<p>With the above considerations taken into account, a good next step is to consider sustainability within content and treat sustainability as any other impact target (such as accessibility or performance) by trying to drive change through metrics data. If research exists to back a particular technique as more performant, it's likely to be more sustainable. Often there will be cases where evidence does not exist as Web sustainability is an evolving field and as such, a common sense approach (considering the variables that can impact people and the planet) will be the best method if metrics data cannot be provided to identify the most sustainable option.</p>
				<p>Every body of work will have its approach to this and a progress over-perfection methodology is preferred (as doing something is ultimately better than waiting for an ideal fix), but as a general consideration for those who are creating documents that are relied upon by large numbers of individuals, the ESG model which doesn't just account for emissions and the environment but also social factors and good governance are an ideal template to work from. In the context of the Internet this accounts for everyday (but important) factors such as performance, accessibility, privacy by design, security, and reducing waste which all as a by-product have an environmental impact.</p>
				<p>It's also important to note that different bodies will have their sustainability challenges, for example, those working on native <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> are more likely to encounter hardware resource consumption (energy usage), whereas language standards will be more considerate of implementors, accessibility, and improving developer workflows. As such, it's worth coordinating with other groups with aligned goals and discussing their sustainability approaches to align work and help improve theirs, accounting for different variables.</p>
				<p class="note">Providing sustainability guidance within work can be presented in many ways. One option is to integrate it within existing guidance or specifications (amending the content). Another is to provide notes or in-page sections dedicated to sustainability providing coverage. Or to gently guide individuals into the subject, a dedicated supplement that will be adapted or merged into the specification at the next major version (giving individuals time to adapt) could be created.</p>

		<section> <!-- Evaluation Methodology -->
			<h2>Evaluation Methodology</h2>
			<p>Evaluating the extent to which a website implements the Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG) is a process involving several steps. The activities carried out within these steps are influenced by many aspects such as the type of website (e.g. static, dynamic, responsive, mobile, application, etc.); its size, complexity, and the technologies used to create the website (e.g. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr>, <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>, <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, etc.); how much knowledge the evaluators have about the process used to design and develop the website; and the main purpose for the evaluation (e.g. to issue a sustainability statement, to plan a redesign process, to perform research, etc.).</p>
			<p>This methodology describes the steps that are common for comprehensive evaluation of the extent of websites and applications to implement WSG 1.0. It highlights considerations for evaluators to apply these steps in the context of a particular product or service. It does not replace the need for quality assurance measures that are implemented throughout the design, development, and maintenance of websites or applications to ensure their sustainability conformance. Following this methodology will help evaluators apply good practice, avoid commonly made mistakes, and achieve more comparable results. However, in the majority of situations using this methodology alone, without additional quality assurance measures, does not directly result in a sustainable product or service that meets the WSG 1.0 success criteria and guidelines.</p>
			<p><strong>This methodology does not in any way add to or change the requirements defined by the normative WSG 1.0 specification</strong>, nor does it provide instructions on feature-by-feature evaluation of web content. The methodology can be used in conjunction with techniques and examples for meeting WSG 1.0 success criteria, such as the techniques documented within this STAR supplement, but does not require this or any other specific set of techniques.</p>
			<p>This methodology is intended for people who are experienced in evaluating Web sustainability using WSG 1.0 and its supporting resources. It provides guidance on good practice in defining the evaluation scope, exploring the target website, selecting representative samples from websites where it is not feasible to evaluate all content, auditing the selected samples, reporting the evaluation findings, and if necessary - implementing sustainable change. It does not specify particular web technologies, evaluation tools, web browsers, or other software to use for evaluation. It is also suitable for use in different evaluation contexts, including self-assessment and third-party evaluation.</p>
			<section class="notoc"> <!-- Purposes for this Methodology -->
				<h3>Purposes for this Methodology</h3>
				<p>In many situations it is necessary to evaluate the sustainability of a website or application, for example before releasing, acquiring, or redesigning the product or service, and for monitoring the sustainability of a website or application over time. This methodology is designed for anyone who wants to follow a common approach for evaluating the compliance of websites to WSG 1.0. This includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Web consultants who want to analyze and report the sustainability  conformance of websites or applications, to inform website owners.</li>
					<li>Web sustainability evaluation service providers who want to evaluate products and services to validate sustainability compliance.</li>
					<li>Website designers and developers who want to evaluate the sustainability compliance of their websites or applications to monitor or improve them.</li>
					<li>Website owners, procurers, and suppliers who want to learn about the sustainability compliance of their websites.</li>
					<li>Web compliance and quality assurance managers who want to ensure that they meet quality and policy requirements.</li>
					<li>Web sustainability monitoring activities are used to benchmark and compare sustainability compliance over time.</li>
					<li>Web sustainability researchers and environmental advocates or activists who want to explore sustainability compliance practices.</li>
					<li>Web sustainability trainers and educators who want to teach approaches for evaluating the sustainability of websites and applications.</li>
					<li>Webmasters, content authors, designers, developers, and others who want to learn more about web sustainability and evaluation.</li>

			<h2>WSG Techniques</h2>
			<section> <!-- Techniques Overview -->
				<h3>Techniques Overview</h3>
				<p>WSG 1.0 guidelines and success criteria are designed to be broadly applicable to current and future web technologies, including dynamic applications, mobile, digital television, etc.</p>
				<p>STAR techniques guide web content authors and evaluators on meeting WSG success criteria and guidelines, which include code examples, resources, and tests. Techniques are updated periodically to cover additional current best practices and changes in technologies and tools.</p>
				<p>The three types of techniques for STAR 1.0 are explained below:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sufficient techniques</li>
					<li>Advisory techniques</li>
					<li>Failures</li>
				</ul>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Techniques are Informative -->
					<h3>Techniques are Informative</h3>
					<p>Techniques are informative, meaning they are not required. The basis for determining conformance to WSG is the success criteria from guidelines within the specification and not the techniques themselves. We also caution against requiring specific techniques or tests mentioned within this document. The only thing that should be required is meeting the WSG success criteria.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Technique Types -->
					<h3>Technique Types</h3>
					<p><em>Sufficient techniques</em> are reliable ways to meet the success criteria.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>From an author or evaluator's perspective: If you use sufficient techniques for a given criterion correctly and it is sustainable within the context of its wider application and usage, you can be confident that you met the success criterion.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><em>Advisory techniques</em> are suggested ways to improve sustainability. They are often very helpful and maybe a significant way of reducing emissions or meeting primary <abbr title="Environment, Social, and Governance">ESG</abbr> objectives.</p>
					<p>Advisory techniques are not designated as sufficient techniques for various reasons such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>They may not be sufficient to meet the full requirements of the success criteria;</li>
						<li>They may be based on technology that is not yet stable;</li>
						<li>They may not be testable;</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Authors are encouraged to apply all of the techniques where appropriate to best address the widest range of sustainability benefits.</p>
					<p><em>Failures</em> are things that cause sustainability issues and fail specific success criteria. The documented failures are useful for:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Authors to know what to avoid,</li>
						<li>Evaluators to use for checking if the content does not meet WSG success criteria.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Content that has a failure does not meet WSG success criteria unless an alternate version is provided without the failure.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Scope and Limitations -->
					<h3>Scope and Limitations</h3>
					<p>In addition to the techniques, there are other ways to meet WSG success criteria. STAR techniques are not comprehensive and may not cover newer technologies and situations. Web content does not have to use STAR techniques to conform to WSG. Content authors can develop different techniques. For example, an author could develop a technique for an existing, or other new technology. Other organizations may develop sets of techniques to meet WSG success criteria. Any techniques can be sufficient if they satisfy the success criterion.</p>
					<p>Publication of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WSG success criteria and conformance requirements. Developers need to be aware of the limitations of specific technologies and provide content in a way that is sustainable on multiple levels.</p>
					<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/">Sustainable Web Design Community Group</a> (<abbr title="Sustainable Web Design Community Group">SWD-CG</abbr>) encourages people to submit new techniques so that they can be considered for inclusion in updates of the STAR 1.0 document. Please submit techniques for consideration using <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues/">GitHub issues</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Testing Techniques -->
					<h3>Testing Techniques</h3>
					<p>Each technique has tests that help:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Authors verify that they implemented the technique properly, and</li>
						<li>Evaluators determine if web content meets the technique.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The tests are only for a technique, they are not tests for conformance to WSG success criteria.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Failing a technique test does not necessarily mean failing WSG, because the techniques are discrete (that is, they address one specific point) and they are not required.</li>
						<li>Content can meet WSG success criteria in different ways other than STAR published sufficient techniques.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>While the techniques are useful for evaluating the content, evaluations must go beyond just checking the sufficient technique tests to evaluate how content conforms to WSG success criteria (considerations such as accessibility, privacy, security, etc).</p>
					<p>Failures are particularly useful for evaluations because they do indicate non-conformance (unless an alternate version is provided without the failure).</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Using the Techniques -->
					<h3>Using the Techniques</h3>
					<p>Techniques for WSG are not intended to be used as a standalone document. Instead, it is expected that content authors will usually use our quick reference to read the WCAG success criteria and follow links from there to specific guidelines within the specification (including examples and techniques).</p>
					<p>Some techniques may describe how to provide alternate ways for visitors to get content. Alternative content, files, and formats must also conform to WSG and meet relevant success criteria, thereby becoming sustainable.</p>
					<p>The code examples in the techniques are intended to demonstrate only the specific point discussed in the technique. They might not demonstrate best practices for other aspects of sustainability, accessibility, usability, or coding not related to the technique. They are not intended to be copied and used as the basis for developing web content.</p>
					<p>Many techniques point to "working examples" that are more robust and may be appropriate for copying and integrating into web content.</p>

							<summary>UX-01: Produce a List of Variables To Monitor for Sustainability Impacts</summary>
							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to create a maintainable list of different variables that may impact the sustainability of a product or service over time. By having this list in place, everyone in the creation process can closely monitor the application or website against each variable to determine if an ESG variable present on the list will require resolution either before, during, or after a product or service is launched.</p>
								<p>This list should be created during ideation if possible but can also be machine-generated from a pre-determined list of known ESG factors using evidence and research. The content of this material could be further tested through automation if such variables can be aligned with product capabilities however at a bare minimum, this list must be publicly visible (such as within a sustainability statement) and utilized in-house to enact sustainable change.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><a href="https://websitesustainability.com/cache/files/variables.pdf">The Variables of Website Sustainability</a> provides a comprehensive map of the various carbon traps that exist on the Internet. From business and external elements to development and rendering, it provides a visual representation of the energy usage that can trigger emissions.</li>

							<summary>UX-02: Use Quantitative Research To Measure the Needs of Visitors and Affected Communities</summary>
							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism for application and website owners to better curate their products and services around the needs of their visitors and those affected by what has been created and in doing so, reduce the ESG burden which can impact the sustainability of the website, especially around the Social (and user-experience) aspect.</p>
								<p>It should be noted that for machine automation, only quantitative feedback will be able to be processed (and therefore useful) and all information gathering must be done sustainably and ethically. It should also be noted that because information is being requested, internal access may be required to formally identify certain characteristics necessary for processing.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><a href="https://www.hotjar.com/quantitative-data-analysis/software/">Quantitative data analysis</a> allows you to identify how your website or application is doing, find patterns in visitor behavior, and make decisions that can benefit your visitors and optimize your product or service to reduce emissions over time.</li>
									<li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-feedback/">Feedback forms</a> are a great way to get qualitative measurements to reinforce the numbers to ensure that any changes you are considering are wanted, satisfy the needs of visitors, and meet the sustainability challenge.</li>

							<summary>UX-03: Identify Visitor Constraints Using Browser Detection and the User-Agent</summary>
							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism so that websites and applications can offer contingency processes for visitors who have constraints such as an older device, an out-of-date operating system, an unusual or out-of-date browser, or a slow Internet connection. Other contingencies exist (such as geo-blocking or mobile data costs) and these can also be taken into account if detection is possible. Each of these issues can burden the user-experience and cause added conflict along the pipeline in terms of emissions.</p>
								<p>Once the constraint has been detected, it will often be up to the developer to create a solution that will involve compatibility features or reducing the load on the visitor's device to increase ease of access. If there are questions regarding the potential compatibility or availability of services due to a certain configuration, seek the manufacturer's advice for further guidance.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>

									<li>Certain political situations may result in the inability for visitors to access your product or service hassle-free such as geo-blocking restrictions, the cost of bandwidth, or government-enacted firewalls, filters, or authentication requirements.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>

							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to go beyond the remit of <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> and accessibility by default and to encourage designers and developers of products to test their creations against a range of specific named types of disabilities to both better understand the conditions and to be able to more structurally and sustainably better test for the unique issues each disability brings to technology in terms of adaptation.</p>
								<p>It is strongly encouraged that teams work with individuals with disabilities when attempting this task as they will have the lived experience to help you better adapt your products and services to their needs. If this isn't possible or you wish to theorize against certain pre-built profiles, you can refer to established medical texts to identify potential symptoms and refer these against issues that may cause technology friction, building solutions, and / or simulators (see color blindness) to help test for issues along the creation process.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>The use of a color-blind filter such as the one built into browser DevTools or another <a href="https://github.com/interaktivarum/rgblind?tab=readme-ov-file">third-party solution</a> potentially helps to identify contrast issues that might not otherwise be detected within an existing website.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Identify visitors or individuals with disabilities who can help you become more accessible.</li>
									<li>Create testable profiles from symptom / issue lists that cause friction.</li>

							<summary>UX-12: Measure Interaction Cost To Reach Every Page in the Information Architecture</summary>
							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to reduce the cognitive load for visitors between the initial visit to a website or application and reaching their final destination where the information they are seeking is located. The path to locating such information can be routed through multiple interactions such as a search mechanism, hyperlinks, form controls (where appropriate), and progressive disclosure features (reducing the complexity involved in reaching a destination will reduce the rendering load leading to sustainability benefits).</p>
								<p>While there is no hard and fast rule regarding the number of clicks required to meet a visitor's expectations, including clear way-finding (breadcrumbs can be machine-identified as can landing page regions to guide visitors along the path). It is therefore a sensible precaution to ensure that the steps required are well documented to avoid overwhelming a visitor. If required, click-through testing can be measured to identify bottlenecks in complex applications.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>While the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/3-click-rule/">three-click rule</a> is a false heuristic, employing common navigation patterns within a header or footer can help visitors traverse a product when multiple click-throughs are necessary to reach a destination faster.</li>
									<li>In complex websites, where multiple levels of documents and potentially thousands of pages may exist, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/navigation-breadcrumbs">having breadcrumbs</a> so that visitors can track their progress through the layers of a system (and even having dropdown navigation menus through each layer) can help with navigating the information architecture of a product or service with fewer barriers to access.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check that the information architecture has been designed with clarity in mind.</li>

							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that visitors can read the materials produced for your website or application and click on interactive content (such as links or buttons) that would otherwise be impaired by other content that due to positioning obscures the material by preventing the page from functioning correctly (wasted clicks, especially if JavaScript functions monitor them could lead to emission costs so its best to avoid unnecessary actions).</p>
								<p>There will be occasions when content should be obscured to progressively disclose additional content, but for unintentional overlapping, obscuring deliberately for attention (unnecessary), and all cases where the visitor did not ask to be impacted, the visibility of the content should be assured (either manually or mechanically through identifying object locations and dimensions plus where conflicts arise, issue remedial advice).</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Advertising is often a cause of content that temporarily overlaps content with the intent of requesting clicks or attention-grabbing to monetize the material on the website or application. While such actions may be financially reasoned, they are rarely sustainably minded.</li>
									<li>Scrollable content in which the scrollbar has been obscured, replaced (with a non-functional, obscured, or hidden replacement), or hidden entirely making it impossible to detect where additional content may occur beyond just the window (such as in overflowing boxes) will be unavailable to visitors making its use of hardware to render a waste of resources.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>

							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to help increase the readability of content within a website or application by breaking down larger pieces of content into smaller constituent pieces. In the same way that a book is broken down into chapters, using progressive disclosure you can reveal sections when the reader is ready, avoiding information overload (the same can be done with long tasks).</p>
								<p>For machine testability, identification of such progressive disclosure markers can be found using the HTML details or dialog element, the CSS target selector (and its accompanying HTML ID attributes), the CSS checkbox hack, the use of JavaScript HashBangs, and also the use of state (and content) changes through various frameworks. Each of these can build a picture of how content displays on-screen during the user-experience, and some can load content only when it is requested which can reduce data transfer and rendering requests leading to sustainability improvements.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Tabs can be a simple way in which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays">you can showcase</a> different pieces of information to an audience. By using a mechanism such as the CSS target selector you can reveal information based on its related HTML ID.</li>
									<li>Dropdown menus such as the one you will find on many websites disclose from a single link several additional roadmapped locations which are grouped children in the information architecture of the product or service.</li>

								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check that progressive disclosure is used appropriately with your content or tasks to perform.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to reduce friction within the user-experience and help reduce the number of dark patterns which might occur onLoad and during the interaction process as these can cause considerable sustainability issues as a result of wasted emissions. By ensuring that the visitor remains in control of the interface and that websites and applications work as expected, a more ethical and optimized product or service is likely to result.</p>
								<p>Machine testing can analyze JavaScript for the use of popup events, the appearance of "_blank" within hyperlinks or frames, or other functionality that exists that may produce overlays. It's important to question the acceptability of such usage for example, opening links in new windows may be acceptable for non-web formats like PDF, otherwise, it's best to advise against its use.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>While not as common today, popup advertisements which appear in a new window or in a separate frame used to be a fixture of the early web and required heavy visitor management to close multiple banners that would trigger.</li>

							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism in which visitors can reduce their impact by choosing to have a more basic experience (to what extent will be up to the developer) by downloading fewer external resources, scripts, and other assets to their machine to be processed and rendered. With this action, a website or application that is already optimized for sustainability can go one step further in providing a barebones format for those wishing to prioritize lowering their footprint over having added functionality.</p>
								<p>This action could be performed by defining what assets have been added to the product or service to enhance the experience but are not of critical importance (such as background images, or decorative flourishes that can be machine identified). Other forms of decoration can also be machine-identified such as CSS flourishes to content and images, background sounds, custom cursors, custom scrollbars, etc.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Web browsers can <a href="https://csscursor.info/">change CSS cursors</a>, and while there may be functional reasons to do so under certain circumstances, such as to indicate loading progress, zoom, or click-ability, in most circumstances, you should leave it at the system default as this is the expected behavior.</li>
									<li>CSS scrollbars <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scrollbars_styling">can be customized</a> or replaced but this can be problematic for visitors. Changes in scroll speed or its mechanics can affect impact readability and the way things render, and color changes can impact visibility and affect overflow regions within elements of the page. In such cases, the system default always functions better than a custom solution.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check decorative images are clearly labeled using ARIA so assistive technologies can skip them.</li>
									<li>Check that CSS decoration can be disabled if it may interfere with readability.</li>
									<li>Check that custom scrollbars and cursors can be disabled as they may interfere with a visitor's ability to interact with the screen.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to increase the findability of the content within your website among search engines and social networks. By creating a <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> sitemap in the base directory of your website, and potentially having a human-readable) HTML sitemap to supplement it, you provide an index of all the publicly available pages. This acts as a potential signpost for individuals who may find themselves seeking information but not knowing exactly where it is stored.</p>
								<p>When creating an HTML sitemap it will be important to categorize pages into lists based on what section of the website they appear in (for human readability) rather than providing everything in a single long list. Structurally, you could use lists within lists to provide this distinction or use subheadings with individual lists. Both methods should ensure to be semantically correct and accessible to meet the social aspect of ESG targets.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>The <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html">Sitemaps protocol</a> showcases a basic XML sitemap format that can be used within the base directory of a website.

							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that visitors and users of an application or website can monitor changes and events that occur over time. The need to be able to track such events is critical as customers become reliant on products and services. This reliance on such features means that time will have been invested into learning how to set up and use the product, which if it fails could have a sustainability impact not just for the product or service owner, but for those reliant on its ability to function.</p>
								<p>Every product or service will have its own update schedule and there will be no hard and fast rule in terms of how often a website or application should be offering new releases. That being said, there should be a mechanism in place to describe news events both in a syndicated format and on the website, and a system status mechanism to identify any current issues with the product or service.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/">Apple has a newsroom</a> that is very minimalistic yet it contains all that you would expect from a news category from a major website. It has grouped stories with useful headlines, dates, categories, and a picture. Having something similar for your website can help visitors find new material quickly and reduce churn digging through archives.</li>
									<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/feed/">Syndication feeds</a> come in multiple different formats but the most common is the <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification"><abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> format</a>. They are compatible with readers on every platform and can be a useful way to get news to subscribers quickly. While these make regular requests to websites, they request less data and result in visitors spending less time browsing overall which is an emissions-positive event.</li>
									<li><a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/">System status pages</a> can be a useful customer metric for keeping up-to-date with ongoing issues and reducing the burden of customer support if something widespread happens to a product or service. It does produce reliance on a third-party but its sustainability benefits relate to the business governance and the data from the product can feed into improving ideation which can include improving all-round sustainability.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check for a news page or category of a website.</li>
									<li>Check the news section has been updated within 12 months.</li>
									<li>Check for a syndication feed in RSS, Atom, or <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>.</li>
									<li>Check the syndication feed has been updated within 12 months.</li>

								<p>The objective of this technique is to use the least amount of permission requests required to achieve a given task. Allowing the visitor to control when they receive information is critically important but it's also important not to burden them with requests to access hardware or do things that might prove invasive (such as triggering notifications or a pop-up window).</p>
								<p>For mechanical testability, JavaScript APIs can check using methods such as requestPermission() to identify if a website or application has been granted access to use various hardware or potentially abusable features within the web browser. Unsubscribe, and delete / freeze account links could also be identified (with internal access being granted).</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Cookie notification messages are required by law (the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Cookie Directive) and could be identified by a script. These are heavily featured within websites and allow visitors to prioritize privacy over the availability of functionality assuming that they are implemented correctly.</li>
									<li>Customizing or removing functionality within applications can help simplify the workflow of a visitor and increase the productivity within an interface (which will have sustainability benefits as it could reduce the weight from unnecessary features loading and visitors spending less time at the screen).</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check which permissions from the available APIs are being granted.</li>
									<li>Check if products or services have unsubscribe / account freezing and removal options.</li>

								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><a href="https://goodlinks.app/">Read-It-Later</a> software may be provided by third-parties but they allow for both offline access to content on a variety of platforms and customization of the materials visually based on the visitor's requirements.</li>
									<li>Quick purchase features (such as Amazon's famous "Buy Now" button) allow for the immediate purchase of a product, skipping past the shopping basket steps and using prior purchase knowledge to reduce friction.</li>

								<p>The objective of this technique is to allow the visitor to achieve the task they initially set out to do and not trigger unnecessary friction in the user-experience which would undermine their ability to complete the said task. Issues such as infinite scrolling can promote a need for continued browsing (which can load excessive data and have a sustainability impact on rendering) and loading overlays that deviate visitors from their path will have wider societal impacts on ESG targets which need to be considered.</p>
								<p>Within this technique, machine testability can be considered by examining if common link pagination landmarks (previous, next, &lt;numbers&gt;, etc) exist within category listings and if overlays or attention-keeping features are detected for common patterns (such as those mentioned in the examples below). If screen addition mechanisms are determined to be in use within a website, this should be considered a failing mark against the related success criteria.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

								<p>The objective of this technique is to use repeating patterns that visitors are likely to recognize from visits to other websites to build a sense of comfort and identification with your products and services. By using established design patterns that are repeatable, recognizable, and testable, you can reduce the amount of confusion likely to occur within a user-interface and this will increase the speed of adaptability (which has sustainability benefits).</p>
								<p>It should be noted that for machine testability, heuristic recognition (identification of patterns in code) will likely allow product creators to recognize the implementation of certain patterns, especially when libraries or design systems are utilized as the backbone of a product or service. Through this, recommendations can be made to improve layouts.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>A website layout could follow a <a href="https://htmlburger.com/blog/website-layout-ideas/">conventional design pattern</a> aimed at a recognized reading flow such as the F or Z pattern. They are based on established scientific studies of how people first identify and then read content on a screen.

								<p>The objective of this technique is to proof your code and content for practices that might detract from the user-experience but are done, purely in an attempt to gain higher rankings from within search engines. While getting such a position would be beneficial, using such techniques will often get the reputation of your site on these services tarnished and your rank will suffer significantly.</p>
								<p>Your visibility in search engines and social media matters. Visibility is how people find you on the web.

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to allow for code that has been produced for an individual project to be re-used and reapplied across future work to reduce redundancy. This is most commonly seen in frameworks and libraries but isn't limited as such and can also apply to documentation and snippets.</p>
								<p>This technique is most useful when it is housed within an open source location to foster a culture of contribution, remixing, and improving of the work. While machine testing of code to determine functionality based on its apparent need would prove problematic, the ability to use importable code can be verified.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>A library like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> can be imported as a whole into a project, but it can also be stripped back, eliminating all but the components that are in use by the website or application powering its functionality.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check to see if deliverables require internal access (if so, permission is given).</li>
									<li>Check to determine if these deliverables are housed in an open source environment.</li>
									<li>Check projects for multiple CSS files (or use of @imports).</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective for this technique is to identify whether the images you are using are firstly necessary (which may be difficult to machine test), and secondly are using a format that is web appropriate. While these considerations may seem small they can dramatically lead to performance benefits that can reduce loading times and page bloat (which is an increasing issue on today's Internet).</p>
								<p>Implementations should consider in necessity the total image count (too many over a certain ratio could be problematic for those with bandwidth limits). Machine testability for web graphics can easily detect older formats that should be replaced immediately, formats that could potentially be changed for optimization purposes, and formats that could become vector graphics.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Certain image formats perform better than others, <abbr title="AV1 Image File Format">AVIF</abbr> and WebP will (in most cases) have better optimization rates than the original three classics for the web (<abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>, <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>, and <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>) and should be considered by default.</li>
									<li>Different devices have different breakpoints, but these shouldn't be used as hard and fast rules for every situation as there are far too many devices out there to be compatible with.

								<p>While it is preferable that only links below the fold have lazy-loading attached to them, there does not appear to be a penalty for including it within all images so if machine testing cannot differentiate this shouldn't be discriminated against as a failing point. Additionally, the point of the fold can change based on the type of device being used so it's worth considering this into processes.</p>

								<p>Because media can involve audio and video, implementors will need to ensure that both are treated with equal respect as they both consume resources and contribute to emissions (to varying degrees).

							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that videos are not only served at the correct resolution but also to identify assets that can help visitors make decisions before choosing to load the main video as to whether the media is correct for them. The location of these links should be connected to the embedded media, and either replace the original video upon click or downloadable for the visitor (they should not increase the number of embeds).</p>
								<p>JavaScript can be used to detect the resolution of the device accessing the media and serve the correct media size for the visitor requesting it (ensuring smaller devices don't get larger media files). Regarding the types of links to be offered, they should provide the visitor with more choice in terms of the quality of the video being consumed or provide added context to its purpose.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>The <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> provides downloadable media files in a variety of formats in addition to being able to stream. This helps reduce the repeat burden on servers and avoids page-reload rendering emissions.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check that the video assets are provided in a variety of common resolutions (which can be user-chosen).</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that you provide details about any audio or video reduction targets and techniques within a publicly available media management and use policy. This will help you to establish the criteria you will attempt to meet across your product or service and allow visitors to identify any failings if they spot them (which can be fixed during the product lifecycle).</p>
								<p>Machine testability for such processes can involve first ensuring that the media management and use policy exists and then checking for a section on audio, video, or media, exists can be a definable way of identifying that the subject is being mentioned. Content can be checked for accuracy through auditing processes and failings flagged up as issues requiring resolution to maintain compliance.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-policy-for-employees/">HootSuite</a> has a template that guides you through the creation of a social media policy, which could easily be adapted to include ethics and ESG factors like sustainability within its criteria (under a new section).</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>

							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to determine if animation usage within an application or website will diminish the user-experience. By calculating the number of animations that occur and identifying if this number firstly can be reduced and then running each of them individually and identifying if they cause lagging on lower specification devices, offering a resolution will help reduce the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> and <abbr title="Graphics Processing Unit">GPU</abbr> burden which can consume vast visitor resources.</p>
								<p>It should be noted that the types of animations used can dramatically affect the rendering process. Certain CSS transitions and animations are more process efficient than others, and JavaScript animation can also have differing impacts on CSS in both the choice of animation and how it has been put together. This should be considered when testing to offer low-impact animations and effects.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Personal portfolios are an ideal place to showcase expertise and you have more liberty to experiment with technologies including animation, which is precisely what <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/">Kent C. Dodds</a>, <a href="https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/">Sarah Drasner</a>, and <a href="https://una.im/">Una Kravetz</a> have done.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check both CSS and JavaScript for animations and calculate the number that exists.</li>
									<li>If too many (based on a justified value) exist, request the removal of the most impactful.</li>

							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism to bypass animated effects that may be included within the page of a website or application. The buttons provided must include a stop / opt-out button as a mandatory option but may also include an option to pause and restart play as optional elements. These buttons must be visible at page load and before animation starts thereby giving the visitor time to action them before effects begin.</p>
								<p>It is preferable that the buttons remain visible when scrolling the page however if the animation is restricted to a certain part of a page then the buttons can also be restricted to that region and be classed as passing the criteria. There should be one universal set of buttons for all animation rather than individual options for every effect (except media such as video).</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>On the <a href="https://12daysofweb.dev/">12 Days of Web</a> advent calendar for web developers, there is a toggle that can be enacted to start and stop an animated snow effect. This is particularly great as the trigger is set to opt-in animation.</li>

							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to avoid rendering issues surrounding emojis and symbol typefaces based on the operating system an individual may be using or the localization of their device. This can inherently cause accessibility issues which can reduce readability as well as the aforementioned visual glitches that can potentially have an impact on system hardware.</p>
								<p>For machine testability, flagging of symbol fonts (and potentially Emojis where operating system compatibility differences may be an issue) will increase readability if resolutions are put in place. One consideration may be to avoid using symbol fonts without an explicit justification and to only use Emojis that have endured widespread operating system compatibility.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Because there are some issues surrounding <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/emojis-and-accessibility/">Emoji use and typography</a>, a guide has been put together showcasing examples of the issues that can prevent visitors from being able to make sense of the content.</li>

							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to optimize a typeface to ensure that when custom fonts are provided, they are implemented as sustainably as possible requiring the fewest amount of resources to download and render as possible. By placing restrictions on the number of custom typefaces and using a highly optimized format (hopefully subsetted), you will have a highly compressed file.</p>
								<p>Multiple variables will contribute to the size of a typeface, as such, it is difficult to simply specify a hard number to aim for, but if (for example) you aren't using international characters and you can subset your font, eliminating such waste could save precious resources from the fonts character table and reduce the file size considerably (reducing the system resource load upon rendering).</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><a href="https://www.colorfonts.wtf/">Color fonts</a> experiment with not just custom typefaces, but with fonts that have multicolor effects built into them. This expands their file size (and is one of many factors which can impact the rendering load).</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check that the number of custom typefaces does not exceed five.</li>
									<li>Check that fonts are preloaded within the head of the HTML document.</li>
									<li>Check that no obsolete font formats are listed (such as <abbr title="Embedded OpenType">EOT</abbr>, <abbr title="TrueType Font">TTF</abbr>, <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphic">SVG</abbr>).</li>

								<p>The alternative format provided should be in HTML as this can be marked up to be Web accessible (and as an open format it can be maintained to be sustainable to meet ESG targets).

							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure cross-platform compatibility when custom fonts are utilized within a product or service. This should be done by providing at least three fallbacks across a variety of different desktop operating systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux), mobile platforms (Android and iOS), and finally offering a generic font family as a last resort to fall back upon.</p>
								<p>Machine testing for suitable typefaces will involve a list of Websafe fonts for each platform to ensure a high probability of compatibility. Statistics about the usage of each platform can be gathered from analytics packages and used to determine which operating systems require support, from there, using a list of pre-installed fonts listed as web-safe will help you define a sustainable stack.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><a href="https://www.apaddedcell.com/web-fonts/">This guide</a> provides a solid overview of Websafe typefaces across a multitude of platforms and includes common software packages such as Microsoft Office (early versions) and even some versions of iOS.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that alternative text is available for descriptive images that are non-decorative and are important to the content of the website or application. Within HTML this can be provided either through the use of the alternative text attribute or through the use of figure captions (which are associated with an image providing added context).</p>
								<p>Machine testability should flag any IMG element that has no alternative text unless it exists within a figure element that contains a figcaption element. There may be cases for decorative purposes where images do not require alternative text, however, these (arguably) should be identified as such and accessibility aids given the notification they can skip over them rather than being ignored.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption">MDN provides documentation</a> and an example of how figcaption can be used to give contextual meaning to an image.

How content is chosen to be written up is at the discretion of the author but to pass the criteria it must be accessible, understandable, and content complete.</p>
								<p>As with all generated external HTML documents, for machine testability (this will include other examples such as UX-51), the generated content must itself pass the WSG guidelines in being sustainable (meeting the Success Criteria as an HTML document that generates emissions).

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>The objective of this technique is to enhance existing media that has been provided to ensure maximum legibility and comprehension.

								<p>Layering additional context upon a video may initially have an additional outlay in terms of emissions (due to the loading of additional files or rendering extra content upon the screen) but because of its social and societal benefits, it meets ESG targets and as such should be prioritized. Testers should therefore seek to identify such features and flag non-availability as an issue.</p>

			<h2>Test Suite</h2>
			<p><a>Interoperability</a> is important to web professionals. Better interoperability among implementations means that web professionals can create websites, applications, and tooling designed to be sustainable, and ensure that it is successfully repeatable (and testable) in several environments. It means reducing the potential for Web sustainability issues to occur in complex projects and reducing the implementation time where automation and tooling can assist during the creation, development, and maintenance process. Writing tests in a way that allows them to be run in all browsers gives implementors confidence that they are shipping software that will be compatible, and consistent with other implementations.</p>
			<p>Good test suites drive interoperability. They are a key part of making sure web standards are implemented correctly and consistently. More tests encourage more interoperability. Wrong tests drive interoperability on wrong behavior. As such, Web Sustainability needs good test suites. It's an evolving field and most of the test suites are still works in progress: so they may contain errors.</p>
			<p>The primary focus of this test suite is to provide interoperability for tool makers (in terms of automation and compliance with the WSGs). In addition, we also aim to provide meaningful testable metrics that can be measured and help identify the true impact of the Success Criteria within the WSGs, and therefore better understand the impact that digital has on the ecosystem.</p>
			<p>Implementors could use the dataset provided to expand upon the results and offer more nuanced research. Additionally, there is the potential for toolmakers to create more accurate products that measure the carbon impact of products. While the scope of such matters may potentially stretch beyond this group's remit, the results could feed back into - and impact further iterations of our work.</p>

				<p>If attempting to create a test to include within or expand the test suite, remember to follow these <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/reviewing-tests/checklist.html">review guidelines</a>. Also, be sure to remember that qualitative as well as quantitative tests are equally valuable as long as they can be tested by machine (and thus automated in some way). As tests will provide a means of identifying whether Success Criteria can offer Automated testing over Manual interventions, notifications of this potential attribute (and methods) will be referenced within the main specification.</p>
