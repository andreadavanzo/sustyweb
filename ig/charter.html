			<!-- Rewrite per W3C: https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues/105 -->
			<h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
			<p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/intro.html">Web sustainability</a> examines how digital technology impacts the physical world using an approach that puts people and the planet first (of critical value in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/#sustainable">Ethical Web Principles</a>). Upcoming or existing <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/policies.html">laws and policies</a> in this sector also set mandatory digital sustainability-related targets. Web sustainability offers many benefits, including accurate measurement and reduction of planetary impact (such as emissions, resource usage, and waste). Web sustainability also includes intersectional issues relating to people (accessibility, privacy, etc.) and shared prosperity (good governance), which can lead to healthier ecosystems overall. PPP (Planet, People, and Prosperity) principles drive these efforts while accounting for a multitude of variables across different disciplines.</p>
			<p>The Sustainable Web Interest Group will provide evidence-led guidance alongside methods to observe, measure, and improve the sustainability of digital products and services. Through this guidance created by web developers, implementers, and other stakeholders of the Internet economy, they may better understand the Internet's impact on various forms of sustainability reporting and evolving implementable holistic practices. This not only includes digital emissions but also interconnecting variables that can additionally impact digital sustainability. To address these challenges, designers, developers, and product teams can apply stewardship principles to digital products, services, and data delivered via the Internet.</p>
		</div>
		<section id="scope" class="scope">
			<h2>Scope</h2>
			<p>The Sustainable Web Interest Group develops and documents guidelines, patterns, processes, and best practices (along with supporting materials) for addressing sustainability issues within digital technology affecting both people and the planet.</p>
			<p>The group provides coverage for websites &amp; web applications, authoring tools &amp; user agents, user experience design, web development (and tooling), hosting &amp; infrastructure, business &amp; product strategy, and metrics data (concerning research, statistics for measurability, and related weighting of the guidelines).</p>
			<p>The Interest Group will focus on the following activities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Publishing a set of guidelines (based upon the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/">CG Draft Report</a>).</li>
				<li>Working with regulatory and standards groups to improve compliance targets within our work.</li>
				<li>Improving measurability (how guidelines are endorsed and weighted through quantitative data) to provide more accurate advice within published deliverables.</li>
				<li>Creating educational materials to foster wider adoption of the guidelines.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Interest Group may recommend mitigations for sustainability issues in existing features of the Web platform, up to and including their deprecation.</p>
			<p>The Interest Group may recommend methods to reduce emissions that reinforce (but don't replace) existing beneficial practices (Accessibility, Performance, Privacy, Security, etc).</p>
			<section id="section-out-of-scope">
				<h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>

		<section id="decisions">
			<h2>Decision Policy</h2>
			<p>This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with participants of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
			<p>However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.</p>
			<p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.</p>
			<p>All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.</p>
			<p>This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.</p>
