# Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSGs)

Welcome to the repository for the [Sustainable Web Design Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/).

In this hub, you will find the draft specification for our [Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/) and any supplementary documentation, including our [introduction](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/intro.html) to Web Sustainability, our [at-a-glance](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/glance.html) overview, our [quick reference](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/quickref.html), our [PDF checklist](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/checklist.pdf), and our [JSON API](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/guidelines.json). We also have a living implementation of the specification under active development called [Sustainable Web Design](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/).

If you would like a brief introduction to both our group and our specification, you may find [the slides](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/TPAC_Slides.pdf) from the presentation we gave at [TPAC 2023](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/breakouts/recording-32.html) useful. To learn more about our group, its goals, and our progress, check out our [wiki](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/wiki/Main_Page), and [frequently asked questions](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions) page.
